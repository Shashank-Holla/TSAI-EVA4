# Monocular Depth Estimation and Mask Prediction

Segmentation and Depth estimate are few key tasks in Computer Vision and are some of the fields where Deep Neural network really shines through. 
Image segmentation is to locate objects and their boundaries in an image. This mainly simplifies the representation of the image into something that is easier and meaningful to analyse, which is particularly useful in medical imaging and recognition tasks. Image segmentation involves creating pixel wise mask for the object in the image. 

Monocular Depth estimate is to gather perception of depth from a single static image. It provides information of how far things are relative to point of view.

The objective of this model is to predict the monocular depth map and also to create masks of the object of interest.


Model building is broken down into the following parts. We will work on the parts and then build the sum.


### Pre model training


- [X] - Data ingestion- Dataset and Dataloader

- [ ] - Image augmentation


### Model Training

- [ ] - Model architecture

- [ ] - Choose the Loss function



### Output of the model

- [ ] - How is the output presented

- [ ] - Show data in Tensorboard


#### Data ingestion- Dataset and Dataloader
