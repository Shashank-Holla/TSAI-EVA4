<h1>L1 and L2 Regularization</h1>
To check the accuracy and loss of the model with L1/L2 regularization. 

*Without L1/L2 changes:* Slight overfitting observed for higher epochs (epoch > 22). Training accuracy- 99.55% and Test accuracy- 99.42%

*With L1 changes:* Slight overfitting observed for higher epochs (epoch > 28). Training accuracy- 99.57% and Test accuracy- 99.46%

*With L2 changes:* Same behaviour as L1.

*With L1 and L2 changes:* Lesser Overfitting. Training accuracy-99.38% and Test accuracy-99.40%
